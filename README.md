1.5 degrees Celcius from The Paris Agreement visualized.

## Paris Agreement

* Legally binding international treaty
* Commitment to stay under 2 degrees Celcius global temparature increase from *pre-industrial levels* until 2030.
* 5-Year circle program of climate actions
  * By 2020 each participating country reported their nationally determined contributions
  * Country communicate those on how to reduce the C02 emissions in order to meet their Paris Agreement goals

## Metrics

* Global Mean Temperature
* Total Greenhouse Gases
* CO2
* Consumption
  * Put it better into perspective. Lot's of people don't understand impact of certain things.
  * What's our budget?
  * Car, plane, bike etc.

### Representation

1. Global Mean Temperature (GMT)
  * Show GMT as number of latest temperature.
2. CO2 Emissions
  * Show CO2 emissions by country as pixels, make scrollable. How to visulize without shaming a country?
  * Maybe just show development of emissions over the years


## Questions

1. What are the pre-industrial levels?
   1. Years: 1850â€“1900
2. Where to find the CO2 emission limits by country?
3. How to measure global warming (temparature)?
   * NASA provides measurements: <https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/global-temperature/>
