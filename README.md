## Paris Agreement

* Legally binding international treaty
* Commitment to stay under 2 degrees Celcius global temparature increase from *pre-industrial levels* until 2030.
* 5-Year circle program of climate actions
  * By 2020 each participating country reported their nationally determined contributions
  * Country communicate those on how to reduce the C02 emissions in order to meet their Paris Agreement goals

## Metrics

* Global Mean Temperature
* Total Greenhouse Gases
* CO2

## Questions

1. What are the pre-industrial levels?
   1. Years: 1850â€“1900
2. Where to find the CO2 emission limits by country?
3. How to measure global warming (temparature)?
